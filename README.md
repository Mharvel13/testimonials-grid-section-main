### What I learned

#### TAILWIND CSS FRAMEWORK


This was my introduction to Using a CSS framework and Tailwind makes Writting CSS easy.
I was able to  install the framework using ``` npm install -D tailwindcss``` , set up a configuration file, make use of the utility classes and also implement responsive design.

Here's a snippet of HTML with tailwind config files below

```html
 <article class="relative m-4 rounded-2xl bg-white p-8 shadow-2xl">
      <div class="my-5 flex items-center">
        <div>
          <img src="images/image-jeanette.jpg" alt="Jeanette's image" class="w-15 mr-3 rounded-full border" />
        </div>
        <div class="font-bold text-Very_dark_grayish_blue">
          <p>Jeanette Harmon</p>
          <p class="opacity-50">Verified Graduate</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="my-5 text-xl font-bold text-Very_dark_grayish_blue">
          An overall wonderful and rewarding experience
        </p>
        <p class="text-Very_dark_grayish_blue opacity-70">
          “ Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now have a
          job I really enjoy, and make a good living while doing
          something I love. ”
        </p>
      </div>
    </article>
    
```
